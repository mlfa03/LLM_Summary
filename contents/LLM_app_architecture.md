# LLM App Architecture

A basic LLM application contains 4 main elements:
* **Foundation LLM**: the foundational model upon which we build (e.g., chatGPT).
* **Vector database**: where we store our private data.
* **Orchestration framework**: the "language" with which we coordinate all parts of the LLM
Application.
* **UI framework**: the user interface (the "face") of the LLM Application.

An advanced LLM App has: 

* **Foundation LLM**: the foundational model upon which we build (e.g., chatGPT).
* **Vector database**: where we store our private data.
* **Orchestration framework**: the "language" with which we coordinate all parts of the LLM
Application.
* **UI framework**: the user interface (the "face") of the LLM Application.
* Backend framework.
* Integrated external APIs.
* Validation framework: quality control of the content.
* **LLMOps**: technical operations to move the application to production.
* **LLM cache**: saves previous answers so they don't have to be searched for again.
* **Cloud provider**: stores the application.
